\noindent \textbf{Intermittently-Powered Devices:} There is plentiful of research results available on energy harvesting, or more specifically wireless power provision, for embedded devices like sensors or microcontrollers. This paragraph is too short to cover this area extensively and we refer the reader to overview papers~\cite{prasad_comst_2014,sample_procieee_2013,huang:commag:2015,visser_procieee_2013,kamalinejad_commag_2015,ku_cst_2016} for in-depth discussion. With power consumption of electronics going down dramatically with every year, computing systems can be now powered completely from ambient energy. This opens new research areas such as radio frequency-powered computers~\cite{patel_pervasive_2017,rf_powered_computing_gollakota_2014}. Indeed, plenty of new embedded platforms appear that are powered solely from ambient (intentional or non-intentional) energy and include~\cite{wisp5,moo,zhao_rfid_2015,holleman_biocas_2008,thomas_jbcs_2012,naderiparizi_rfid_2015,rodriguez_tbcs_2015,liu_sigcomm_2013,kicksat,nadeau_naturebio_2017}. But there is a price tag associated to them: harvested energy is miniscule, unstable, difficult to predict ergo \emph{intermittent}. Therefore, to guarantee completion of computing, programming and runtime models are being actively researched that are specifically tailored to these intermittently-powered systems. \todo{Revise this section}{Brandon}

\noindent \textbf{Intermittent Execution Environments:} Earlier work include Dewdrop~\cite{dewdrop} (splitting task such that they fill-in the capacitor). Similar, specific-application tailored system includes Wisent and Stork~\cite{stork,wisent}. Checkpoint runtimes include DINO~\cite{dino}, Quickrecall~\cite{quickrecall}, Hibernus/Hibernus++~\cite{hibernus,hibernusplusplus} are checkpointing-based systems requiring hardware support to measure remaining storage energy---a feature prohibitive given typical high energy cost expenditure of such hardware. The only available Task-based intermittent runtime systems are Chain~\cite{chain} and Alpaca~\cite{alpaca}. \sys goes beyond what any task-based system performed by providing \emph{automatic} task creation and \emph{adaptivity} to energy state and energy storage \emph{obliviousness} of the compiled code. \todo{complete this section}{Przemek}
