	Dear Editor-in-Chief,

	I am sending to you a manuscript entitled "Coala: Dynamic Task-Based Intermittent Execution for Energy-Harvesting Devices" to be considered for publication in ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks. 

	Coala advances intermittent software execution, which drives battery-free tiny sensors, by predicting the amount of ambient energy arrival and adapts the execution accordingly. Battery-free sensors and actuators are expected to play an important role in health-care, building monitoring, and space applications. Our experiments show that Coala optimizes applications execution, running on energy harvesting devices, by up to 54\% as compared to the state-of-the-art intermittent system. 


	We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by \emph{ACM Transactions on Sensor Network}, as its scope falls within the scope of the journal. This work has not been published or simultaneously submitted elsewhere. Thank you in advance for considering our submission.
