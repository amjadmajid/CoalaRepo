We prototype \sys and use its API to implement a set of benchmark applications representative of the embedded domain. We build the applications and deploy the binaries onto a real energy-harvesting device. 

%In this section we describe the setup for the experiments presented in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} and characterize the benchmark applications.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:results_hardware_software}
\add{
We used three different setups to evaluate \sys: 
(i) an RF-powered energy-harvesting device, WISP\,5.1~\cite{wisp5,wisp}, with a fixed capacitor size of 47\,$\mu$F; 
(ii) an MSP-EXP430FR5969 launchpad~\cite{MSP-EXP430FR5969_launchpad} powered by a BQ25570~\cite{BQ25570EVM-206_website} solar power harvester that is connected to an IXYS SLMD121H04L solar cell~\cite{SLMD121H04L_website} for experimenting with different energy buffers; and
(iii) an MSP-EXP430FR5969 launchpad~\cite{MSP-EXP430FR5969_launchpad} that is continuously powered.
} 

\add{
Every benchmark used in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} was run repeatedly on
each platform for a few minutes to ensure capturing a diverse power 
trace. The exact number of iterations depends on the ambient power intensity and the application itself.
In our experiments, the number of complete runs ranges from 4 to 125.
}

WISP contains the MSP430FR5969~\cite{wolverine} MCU with 64\,kB of
non-volatile (FRAM) memory and 2\,kB of volatile (SRAM) memory and was
configured to 1\,MHz clock speed.
We powered WISP using an RF signal generator emitting a 20\,dBm sinusoidal wave at 915\,MHz.
The signal generator was connected to the Laird RFMAX S9028PCRJ 8\,dBic
antenna~\cite{atlas2015}.
The antenna was oriented towards and in parallel with WISP's antenna, and
no objects obstructed the path.
We affixed WISP with a paper harness at the edge of a table at a height, from the table surface, of 10\,cm.
For distance-controlled experiments we positioned WISP at $d=\{15, 30,
50\}$\,cm from the exciter antenna.
To obtain execution time, the software toggled GPIO pins at sections of the code
under profile, and the Saleae~\cite{saleae} logic analyzer measured
intervals between edges in the signal. For continuous power experiments, the 
execution time was measured using the clock features in TI Code Composer Studio IDE version 7.1.

\label{table:benchmark_table}
\end{table}%

We evaluated \sys using six benchmarks that are often used in embedded systems (summarized in Table~\ref{table:benchmark_table}). All applications were compiled using MSP430 GCC~\cite{ti-gcc} version 6.4.0 with \texttt{-O1} as optimization flag. The source code for all benchmarks will be released at \cite{coala_website}.

\paragraph{Comparison with Alpaca using the GCC compiler.}

We compare \sys against Alpaca~\cite{alpaca}, the state-of-the-art task-based system for intermittent computing. For a fair comparison, the task decomposition of the benchmarks is ensured to be the same for both systems.
%
Since Alpaca's compiler pass is implemented only for LLVM, we could not use that implementation to instrument the benchmarks and compile them with GCC. Instead, we \emph{manually} performed the instrumentation done by the compiler pass. The instrumentation consists of identifying WAR dependencies  and adding code and memory allocations to make a private copy of the affected variables.
By compiling both systems with the same compiler (GCC), we ensure that our comparison in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} is fair.
