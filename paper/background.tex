\subsection{Energy Harvesting Systems}
\label{sec:background_harvesting}

Energy harvesting devices operate using energy extracted from sources such as
radio frequency transmissions and solar energy. These devices elide tethered
power or a battery, instead collecting energy into a capacitor, operating when
sufficient energy accumulates, and upon depleting the energy, turning off and
recharging.
%
%Batteryless operation has a number of important advantages, making intermittent computing an important research domain. Supplying power to billions~\cite{gartner_iot} of embedded computers using batteries is not sustainable. The European Commission estimates that more than 160 kilotons of consumer batteries enter the European Union annually~\cite{eu_batteries_2016}. Batteries are an environmental risk, are fragile, are limited in their number of charge/discharge cycles, and may require costly physical maintenance that is difficult or impossible deployed (e.g. in space~\cite{kicksat}). By contrast, super-capacitors are durable, promising millions of charge/discharge cycles~\cite[Sec. I]{ongaro_pwre_2012}. The main limitation in moving to capacitor-based energy storage is that capacitor energy density---and consequently operating discharge time---is orders of magnitude less than a battery. 
%
%Given current technology development, battery-less systems are best suited for very long-term sensing and monitoring where access to recharge is either prohibitive or impossible. These include battery-less image capture and processing~\cite{naderiparizi_rfid_2015}, animal monitoring~\cite{thomas_jbcs_2012} or implantable~\cite{rodriguez_tbcs_2015} and digestible~\cite{nadeau_naturebio_2017} sensors.
%
There are several energy harvesting battery-less hardware platforms. For
instance, computational RFIDs---open-source TI MSP430-based~\cite{wolverine}
WISP~\cite{wisp5} (with its variants such as
WISPCam~\cite{naderiparizi_rfid_2015}, NFC-WISP~\cite{zhao_rfid_2015} or
NeuralWISP~\cite{holleman_biocas_2008}), Moo~\cite{moo}, and commercial ones
such as~\cite{medusa_farsens_2017}. Other platforms include ambient backscatter
tag~\cite{liu_sigcomm_2013,parks_sigcomm_2014} or battery-less
phone~\cite{talla_imwut_2017}. 

%In all of the above, the main source of energy harvested is the electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency range (ambient transmitters such as high power TV transmitters~\cite{liu_sigcomm_2013} or dedicated RFID antenna~\cite{wisp5,moo,talla_imwut_2017,medusa_farsens_2017,holleman_biocas_2008,naderiparizi_rfid_2015}). Naturally, other forms of energy harvesting sources exist, including temperature gradient, (micro-)motions, light/sun radiation, vibrations, and body fluid flow (blood, gastric acid). Several recent surveys discussing energy harvesting, low-power, embedded systems and intermittent computing at a high level~\cite{paradiso_pvc_2005,soyata_csm_2016,prasad_comst_2014,ku_cst_2016,lucia_snapl_2017}.

\textbf{Hardware Assumptions.} \sys is designed for the demands of existing and
future energy-harvesting platforms based around general purpose, commodity
computing components~\cite{wisp,msp430datasheet}. We assume a device with a
memory system that has fast, byte-addressable volatile and non-volatile memory;
in particular, our target platform, WISP~\cite{wisp}, is equipped with a
mixture of SRAM and FRAM. Our implementation leverages hardware support for
fast, bulk-copying between memories via DMA~\cite{msp430datasheet}. \sys do not
require architectural additions to commodity processors as
in~\cite{su_date_2017,hicks_isca_2017,quickrecall,nvp}. \sys supports I/O
behavior similar to~\cite{alpaca,chain}, allowing safe, synchronous I/O and
unsafe, asynchronous I/O.

Software running on an energy-harvesting device executes {\em intermittently}
because energy sources are not always available to harvest and buffer
sufficient operational energy. An intermittent execution is composed of
operating periods interspersed with power
failures~\cite{dino,chain,alpaca,ratchet}. The frequency of failures depends on
the size of the device's energy storage buffer: a larger buffer allows longer
operating periods. 
%Energy-harvesters provide input power orders of magnitude less than operating power, making recharging negligible during operation.
%Intermittent execution is different from continuous execution. 
A power failure clears volatile state (e.g., registers and SRAM) while
non-volatile memory (e.g., FRAM) persists. Upon a power failure, control flows
to a prior point in the execution: by default, to the beginning of {\tt
main()}. Early intermittent systems preserved progress by periodically
checkpointing volatile execution context to non-volatile
memory~\cite{mementos}, sometimes using hardware
support~\cite{mottola2017harvos,hibernusplusplus,hibernus,idetic,quickrecall}.

%	\label{fig:code_demo_incosistency}
%\end{figure}

Checkpointing volatile state alone do not ensure data consistency when the
system can directly manipulate non-volatile memory~\cite{mspcdino}.
Especially, data can get inconsistent when code includes a
\emph{write-after-read} (WAR) dependence between operations that manipulate
non-volatile memory, because it allows {\em writes} from a failed attempt to
persist across failure and be read by the {\em
reads}~\cite{ratchet,dino,alpaca} ---see
Figure~\ref{fig:code_demo_incosistency} that illustrates how state can become
inconsistent in an intermittent execution using the cyclic redundancy check
(CRC) code from MIBench2~\cite{hicks_mibench2_2016}.  Additional method to
maintain data consistent in the presence of WAR dependency is necessary for
correct execution.
%Checkpoints of volatile state preserve intermittent progress, but do not ensure data consistency~\cite{dino,chain,ratchet}. Data may become inconsistent if an attempt to execute some computation {\em writes} to a non-volatile variable, then power fails, then a second attempt to re-execute the same computation incorrectly {\em reads} the value written in the first attempt, rather than the variable's original value. The situation occurs when code includes a \emph{write-after-read} (WAR) dependence between operations that manipulate non-volatile variables~\cite{ratchet,dino,alpaca}---see Figure~\ref{fig:code_demo_incosistency} that illustrates how state can become inconsistent in an intermittent execution using the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code from MIBench2~\cite{hicks_mibench2_2016}.
%Figure~\ref{fig:code_demo_incosistency} illgit statuustrates how state can become inconsistent in an intermittent execution using the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code from MIBench2~\cite{hicks_mibench2_2016}. The code computes the CRC for an $\texttt{nBytes}$ byte message $\texttt{msg}$ with remainder $\texttt{Rmnd}$.
%Despite checkpointing at line 3 in Fig.~\ref{fig:crc_example}, the code may compute  $\texttt{data}$ incorrectly because of the read of $\texttt{Rmnd}$ on line 4 and the write of $\texttt{Rmnd}$ on line 5. Figure~\ref{fig:crc_example_war} shows an intermittent execution. The second iteration writes $\texttt{Rmnd}$, but power fails before the checkpoint. After restarting, line 9 reads the updated value of $\texttt{Rmnd}$, producing an incorrect $\texttt{data}$ value. Checkpoint-based systems risk violating memory consistency~\cite{dino}. 
%To maintain consistency, prior systems~\cite{dino} {\em version} a subset of non-volatile data with the checkpoint. Task-based systems~\cite{chain,alpaca}, which we focus on, ensure consistency using programmer, compiler, and runtime support.


\subsection{Task-based Intermittent Programming}
\label{section:background_task_computing}

Task-based execution models~\cite{dino,chain,alpaca} ask the programmer to
decompose their program into tasks, which is a region of code that can contain
arbitrary computation, sensing, and communication.  Task-based models keep
progress at the granularity of tasks by repeatedly trying to re-execute each
task on power failure until it successfully finishes, only then moving on to
the next task.  Since these models do not rely on taking an expensive
checkpoint, it is usually faster than the checkpoint-based
solution~\cite{chain, alpaca}.  \sys also follows the paradigm of the
task-based programming model, where the programmer explicitly expresses the
application as a sequence of tasks and the transition between them.
%Task-based runtime systems ensure that repeated task executions are idempotent. 
%The key to idempotence is ensuring that non-volatile updates made by an interrupted task are never visible to a future task execution.  
%A programmer describes task control-flow as a {\em task graph}. Task flow happens at programmer demarcated transition points that may be conditional on program values. 
%Task-based programming abstractions guarantee that tasks execute {\em atomically}, regardless of power failures. 

Task-based models also suffer from data inconsistency when there is a WAR
dependence.  Prior systems tried to tackle the problem by a compiler-automated
redo-logging for the variables that is part of the dependence~\cite{alpaca}, or
by statically creating a multiple copies of the problematic variable to ensure
that no task reads and writes the same copy~\cite{chain}.
%There are several run time strategies to ensuring task idempotence. One approach~\cite{alpaca}, is to identify non-volatile data involved in WAR dependences in a task (like DINO~\cite{dino} and Ratchet~\cite{ratchet} did for checkpoints), execute the task using private copies of those data, and commit the private copies on task completion. Another way is to statically create multiple versions of non-volatile data shared by tasks and ensure that no task reads and writes the same version~\cite{chain}. Regardless of the strategy, task-based systems execute statically-defined tasks atomically, completing in one or more attempt. 

\subsection{Costs of Previous Models}
\label{sec:cost_task-based}

Prior systems, including the task-based models, suffer from two major overheads:
{\em frequent non-volatile memory access} and {\em incorrectly sized, inefficient or non-terminating tasks}.

	\label{table:chechpoint_comparison}
\end{table}


\textbf{Frequent Non-volatile Memory Access.} 
Previous systems frequently access the non-volatile memory directly, which 
is a potential source of inefficiency.  Checkpointing systems copy all volatile
state~\cite{dino, mementos, ratchet, hicks_isca_2017} to non-volatile memory at
every checkpoint.  Task-based models, which do not take checkpoints, back up a
subset of non-volatile data to maintain memory consistency using, e.g.,
redo-logging.  Table~\ref{table:chechpoint_comparison} summarizes the data that
gets copied to and from the non-volatile memory in service of memory
consistency and progress preservation.  Ratchet~\cite{ratchet} and
Clank~\cite{hicks_isca_2017}, which require all memory to be non-volatile
perform high frequency non-volatile memory accesses, into checkpointing
frequently.

%Intermittent execution models incur overheads to checkpoint data~\cite{dino,ratchet,quickrecall,mementos}, manage channels~\cite{chain}, or privatize and commit data~\cite{alpaca}. Table~\ref{table:chechpoint_comparison} compares overheads for recent intermittent execution models (cf. \cite[Sec. 2.4]{alpaca}.) The mechanism responsible for overhead in each model varies, but the bulk of overhead in all models is a manipulating non-volatile memory. Checkpointing moves data to and from non-volatile memory, channel accesses manipulate non-volatile data~\cite{chain}, privatization copies from and commits to non-volatile memory~\cite{alpaca}, and idempotence solutions~\cite{ratchet} use {\em only} non-volatile memory.

%\end{figure}
As an illustration, we measured the energy cost of volatile SRAM and non-volatile FRAM accesses on
the MSP430FR5969~\cite{msp430datasheet} MCU. We used EDB~\cite{edb} to monitor
voltage drop on a capacitor powering the device across 1600 read and write
accesses to each memory, randomizing accesses to avoid caching effects. Our
data showed that a non-volatile memory access consumes around 1.5 times the
energy of a volatile access. The data confirm that, because non-volatile memory
accesses are more expensive than volatile memory accesses, prior systems that
frequently access non-volatile memory may be artificially inefficient.
%~\cite{}. \todo{add citation to TI specification on FRAM energy cost}{Przemek}. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:framEnergy} summarizes the data, showing that a non-volatile memory access consumes around 1.5 times the energy of a volatile access in this device. This observation is also consistent with the TI specification~\cite{}. \todo{add citation to TI specification on FRAM energy cost}{Przemek} 
\sys is motivated by this observation: \sys 
moves data pages from FRAM to SRAM to maximize SRAM accesses and minimize FRAM
accesses, to decrease energy consumption and increase the time between power
failures. 

%The cost of non-volatile memory motivates \sys, which virtualizes memory to primarily use SRAM.

%The above result reassures the intuitive observation that a decrease of checkpoint frequency (CP) decreases the energy cost associated with each state preservation method and reduces operation cost which in most simplistic terms is defined as $\mathcal{O}(\text{CP})+\mathcal{O}(\text{PL})$, where PL is the cost of program execution without checkpointing. On the other hand, this increases task/checkpoint re-execution time. The ideal solution is a runtime that \emph{adaptively} changes task size during runtime, which however exposes a second problem.

%\textbf{Task-based Models have Syntactic Limitations.} State of the art task-based programming models, Alpaca~\cite{alpaca}, has substantial limitations that prohibit writing generic programs. First, for Alpaca (and Chain~\cite{chain}), accesses to protected variables must be applied \emph{only} by using the variable's name, i.e. reference by variable address is not possible. This limitation implies that existing third-party libraries, such as MCU-tailored FFT library~\cite{}, cannot be implemented to support Alpaca or Chain (not to mention the impossibility of the development of an intermittent-safe \texttt{memcpy}). Furthermore, if a protected variable needs to be accessed in a code path that is not predictable by the compiler, for instance an Interrupt Service Routine, Alpaca cannot protect that access.

\textbf{Incorrectly Sized Tasks.} Compiler-inserted checkpoints or
programmer-defined tasks can both both incorrect and non-terminating or
inefficient.  If code between consecutive checkpoints or in a task (we refer to
both scenarios as ''code in a task'' in this section) consumes {\em more} than the fixed,
maximum energy that the device can buffer, then the task
will never be able to complete using buffered energy.  Such a task is
non-terminating, {\em prevents forward progress}, and makes the program
incorrect. 
%
If the task consumes far {\em less} energy than a device can buffer, the system
may operate {\em inefficiently}, checkpointing or transitioning between tasks
more often than needed. 
%
Avoiding excessively costly, non-terminating tasks and short, high-overhead
tasks is challenging both to the programmer and the compiler, because
estimating the exact energy use of an arbitrary code is complicated.  When {\em
porting} a program from one platform to another, the problem becomes worse
because an excessively costly task on one device may be a relatively short task
on a device with a larger buffer.  Buffer sizes on different platforms vary
widely from, e.g., 20\,$\mu $F~\cite{rodriguez_tbcs_2015} to 0.1\,F~\cite{moo},
complicating the problem.
%
As a solution, \sys's execution model presents {\em task coalescing}, which
merges multiple tasks to amortize the overhead when tasks are too small, and
{\em task downscaling}, which breaks up a task when the task is too large to complete. 
%When a task and its successor both complete, the two tasks were interleaved by a task boundary that preserves progress and state (i.e., checkpoint or commit). However, absent a power failure, the work to preserve state was {\em unnecessary}, incurring overhead on the tasks' executions. Avoiding excessively costly, non-terminating tasks and short, high-overhead tasks is a programming challenge, given fixed hardware (no support from dedicated circuitry to measure the state of energy buffer) with a fixed energy buffering capacity. Buffer sizes from prior work on intermittently-powered computing hardware vary widely from 20\,$\mu $F~\cite{rodriguez_tbcs_2015} to 0.1\,F~\cite{moo}. Sizing tasks complicates {\em porting} code from one device to another. An excessively costly task on a device with a small energy buffer may be a relatively short task on a device with a larger buffer. The key problem is that using existing systems, by defining tasks statically for a fixed energy buffer, the programmer either risks non-termination or poor performance due to high overhead. \sys's execution model based on {\em task coalescing} and {\em task downscaling}.  Coalescing dynamically merges multiple tasks based on execution behavior to amortize the cost of committing each task separately. Downscaling breaks up a single task into multiple subtasks that commit individually to avoid executing a single task that is too large to complete using the device's buffered energy.  Section~\ref{sec:task_adaptation}describes \sys's adaptive coalescing and downscaling mechanisms in detail. The main enabler for \sys's adaptation is its novel \emph{memory virtualization} mechanism, which is described in Section~\ref{sec:memory_virtulaization}.

%\textbf{Motivating the Design of \sys's Execution Model.} The challenge of \em{efficiently} executing a program under frequent power failures, lies in the fact the the program needs to be energy aware. This challenge becomes even bigger when \em{generality} is a design requirement and such the system must not require a specific hardware circuitry to offer its efficiency. \em{Fllexibility} is key for wide adaptation, therefore, \sys's execution model should not limit the programmer to a subset of the functionality of the underlying software technology. \em{\sys champions an efficient, general, and flexible intermittent execution.}
