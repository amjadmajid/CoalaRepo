Coala benchmarks  
--- Done 
- Choose a set of apps and test it on GCC  [max 7   days] [17 Aug -> 09 Sep]
- Cleanup Githup repository (collect all final versions of the programs used 
  for plots we did in the paper)

--- To Be done
- Plot average virtual task size		   [max 1/2 days] [29 Sep]	
- Plot time diagram of coalescing (Coala 
  vs Chain) for all tasks 				   [max 1   days] [11 Oct]
- Plot diagram of task size versus number 
  of tasks for all tasks				   [max 1   days] [12 Oct]
- Investigate other coalescing strategies  [max 2   days] [19 Oct -> 20 Oct]
- develop and test a new coalescing algo   [max 3   days] [02 Oct -> 05 Oct]
- Given average power/distance what is 
  the average power interrupt rate         [max 1/2 days] [13 Oct] 
- Measure the effect of the buffer size on 
  the coalescing algorithm 				   [max 1/2 days] [29 Sep]
  
- Make EDB completely work on our computers[max 3   days] [17 Sep -> 20 Sep]
- Get Kiwan compiler to work on my machine [max 3   days] [20 Sep -> 25 Sep]
- re-generate all the results 			   [max 3   days] [25 Sep -> 28 Sep]
- Make chain works 						   [max 3   days] [06 Oct -> 10 Oct]
- Run intermittent FFT with Coala and 
  measure its performance				   [max 1/2 days] [13 Oct] 
- Investigate checkpointing with DMA       [max 3   days] [16 Oct -> 18 Oct]

[23 Oct -> 27 Oct] 

- Introduce on-the-fly task splitting (inverse of coalescing, but per task)
- Two pages in SRAM 
- Measure finally ADC energy cost of capacitor charge measurement
