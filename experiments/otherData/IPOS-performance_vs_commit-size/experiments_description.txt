This experiment is used to measure the performance of IPOS versions.

The measurement metric:
	time-to-compelation. 

The measurement tool: 
	Logic 16 (a logic analyzer from www.saleae.com)

The hardware to be used:
	TI launchpad MSP430FR5969 (mcu: MSP430FR5969)

The applications to be tested are: 
	1- largeDataCommit: 
		In each iteration the app manipulate a certain number (2^0 -> 2^7) of variables and commit them. 
		The DMA approach always commit 2^7 variables.  The ipos performance limitted version could not 
		manipulate 128 variables. It raises a "heap, stack collision problem".
