This experiment is to compare FRAM and SRAM

The measurement metric:
	time-to-compelation and energy consumption

The measurement tool: 
	Logic 16 (a logic analyzer from www.saleae.com)
	EnergyTrance in Code Composer Studio 

The hardware to be used:
	TI launchpad MSP430FR5969 (mcu: MSP430FR5969)

Experiments descriptions
	Experiment 1: 
		An app writes randomly to 400 elements array 1600 random values. 
		This array once it resides in FRAM once in SRAM. logic will be used
		to monitor the time of the operation, and the energyTrace to monitor
		the energy consumption. 
		This experiment will be done using tow different CPU speed (1 and 16 MHz)
